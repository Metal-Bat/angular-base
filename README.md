# ng-architect

An Angular 21 standalone starter for applications organized around domain boundaries. The current application is the Angular welcome screen; domain features, authentication, and backend integration are left to applications built from this starter.

## Getting started

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AminAzarpey/ng-architect.git
cd ng-architect
mise trust
mise install
mise run install
mise run dev
```

The development server runs at http://localhost:4200. `mise.toml` pins Node 24.21.0, npm 12.2.0, RTK 0.47.0, graphifyy 0.9.53, and Husky 9.1.7. Husky is also a local development dependency so installation configures the repository hooks.

## Stack and checks

Angular uses 21.2.25, CLI/build 21.2.24, and Material/CDK 21.2.14. TypeScript stays on 5.9.3 to match Angular's compiler compatibility. Tailwind CSS 4 is connected through PostCSS, alongside the Material theme in `src/styles.scss`. PrimeNG 21.1.10 is also configured with Aura and PrimeIcons. The official `tailwindcss-primeui` plugin supplies PrimeNG semantic utilities. Keep PrimeNG, Material, and Tailwind available together; choose components through local imports. See [UI library choices](docs/UI-LIBRARIES.md) for examples and design boundaries.

| Command                         | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mise run check`                | Check formatting, application types, lint, unit tests, and production build |
| `mise run build`                | Build for production                                                        |
| `mise run lint`                 | Check lint without rewriting files                                          |
| `mise run test`                 | Run Vitest unit tests once                                                  |
| `mise exec -- npm test`         | Run unit tests in watch mode                                                |
| `mise exec -- npm run lint:fix` | Apply lint fixes                                                            |
| `mise exec -- npm run format`   | Format maintained project files                                             |
| `mise exec -- npm run commit`   | Open the Conventional Commits prompt                                        |

The Angular build worker pool uses a scoped Piscina 5.3.2 override for [the patched prototype-pollution advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67c8-pqhq-4rmx).

Tests use Angular's unit-test builder with Vitest and jsdom. The starter does not include an end-to-end test suite. VS Code tasks and launch configurations use mise to select the same tool versions.

## Domain-oriented organization

Keep business rules independent of UI and transport libraries. As features are added, group their domain models, application use cases, infrastructure adapters, and presentation components under `src/app/features/<domain>/`. Use `core` for application-wide infrastructure and `shared` for reusable UI and utilities. These are architectural conventions, not implemented business features in this starter. See [extending the starter](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [maintenance notes](docs/UPGRADE.md).

## Git and release workflow

Husky runs lint-staged before commits, validates Conventional Commit messages, and runs the full check task before pushes. Commitizen, commitlint, and release-it support the existing release workflow.

```sh
mise exec -- npm run release
```

The release command updates the version and changelog and can create and push release commits, tags, and a GitHub release. Use it only when preparing a release.

## AI-assisted development

Repository skills under `.agents/skills` provide Angular, Material, PrimeNG, Tailwind, and optional library guidance. Skills for NgRx, Angular Aria, or AngularFire do not install or configure those libraries. PrimeNG and Material are both available for presentation components. The graphify skill and `AGENTS.md` describe codebase graph navigation and updates. `CLAUDE.md` and `.rtk/filters.toml` document RTK usage.

Generated `graphify-out/` content and local `.codex/hooks.json` are ignored. Skill files are excluded from the application formatting check so their supplied content is preserved.
